This contains all of the code necessary to create the streamlit app and also run the simulations. 

The current alpha is fairly barebones, but it works and that was all the goal really was at this point. The next steps (in rough order I'll go after them) are:

1. Create different options for voter strategies (i.e. if closest is too far, don't vote)
2. General algorithm performance improvement
3. Allow for users to download results
4. Various comestic changes (making sure parties get consistent colors, etc)
5. New KPI plots
6. Vary voting systems (rank choice, proportional, etc)
